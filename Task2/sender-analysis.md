**Sender Name:** "PayPal Security"  
**Sender Email:** alert@paypalsecure-notice.com  


## 1. Suspicious Domain Name
The domain **paypalsecure-notice.com** is NOT an official PayPal domain.

Legitimate PayPal emails come from:
- paypal.com
- e.paypal.com
- paypal-email.com

The phishing domain:
- Uses words like “secure” and “notice” to look authentic  
- Is newly registered and not owned by PayPal  
- Does not match any official PayPal communication channels  

**Conclusion:** Domain is fraudulent.


## 2. Lookalike Domain Used in Link
The body contains a link from **paypa1-verification-center.com**, where the letter **L** is replaced with **1** (paypa**1**).

This is a classic spoofing method to mislead users into thinking it is PayPal.


## 3. Mismatch Between “From” and “Reply-To”
- **From:** alert@paypalsecure-notice.com  
- **Reply-To:** noreply@paypal.com  

Attackers add a real-looking Reply-To to appear legitimate.

This discrepancy is a major red flag and often used to bypass simple filters.


## 4. No SPF/DKIM/DMARC Authentication
Phishy behavior expected:

- No **SPF** alignment  
- No **DKIM** signature  
- Failing **DMARC** checks  

Legitimate PayPal emails ALWAYS use strong authentication mechanisms.


## 5. Generic Sender Name
The display name “PayPal Security” is generic.

Official PayPal communication uses names such as:
- “PayPal”
- “PayPal Services”
- “PayPal Support”

Attackers often use generic team names to appear authoritative.


## ✔ Conclusion
The sender address **alert@paypalsecure-notice.com** shows multiple phishing indicators:
- Fake/unauthorized domain  
- From vs Reply-To mismatch  
- No proper email authentication  
- Lookalike domains impersonating PayPal  
- Generic sender name with suspicious formatting
