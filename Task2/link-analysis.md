### **Displayed Link (what the user sees)**
### **Actual Hyperlink (hidden behind the text)**
---

## Why This Link Is Suspicious

### 1. Fake Lookalike Domain (“paypa1”)
The attacker replaces the letter **L** with the number **1**:
- paypa**l** → paypa**1**

This is a common phishing method to trick users.

### 2. Non-PayPal Domain
Official PayPal domains include:
- paypal.com  
- paypalobjects.com  
- e.paypal.com  

The domain **paypa1-verification-center.com** is:
- Not owned by PayPal  
- Registered to anonymous/foreign hosting  
- Designed to impersonate PayPal

### 3. Uses HTTP Instead of HTTPS
- No encryption  
- Credentials entered will be stolen  
- Legit PayPal login pages always use **HTTPS with SSL certificates**

---

### 4. Fake Login Path
The link leads to a page designed to:
- Steal PayPal login credentials  
- Capture 2FA code  
- Possibly steal credit card details  


### 5. No Attachments, but Fake “Case ID”
The email references:
This is meant to:
- Give false legitimacy  
- Trick victims into acting quickly  
- Create fear and urgency  

There is *no actual file attached*, but the fake case ID serves as a form of social engineering.
